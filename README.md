# Regex-Based Data Extraction
This project demonstrates how to use regular expressions (regex) in Python to extract and process various data types from text files. The exercises include extracting names from a sentence, filtering students based on grades, and parsing web log files into structured dictionaries.

## Overview
This project is focused on extracting and processing data from various sources using regular expressions. The data is extracted from different types of text formats, including:
1. Simple sentences (Part A)
2. A student grade file (Part B)
3. Web log data (Part C)
   
Each part provides a practical exercise for extracting specific information and using regex to structure and process it.
